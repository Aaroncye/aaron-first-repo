# Aaron's Portfolio

Sharing about me both professionally and personally in the website. Things included such as achievements, hobbies, contact, get-in-touch, and also some of my projects done in poly so far. 
 
## Design Process
The design of the website was made with an intent for a clean and satisfying look hence why I also had abit of the MAC OS look of the webpage for it. The website shares about me as a person what skills I have, career I like to get into, my social links, my achievements made. So to inform interested parties such as companies who would like to hire me to have a easy access to look through about me without having to research much.

The wireframe I had was a base and then I began to include new designs along the way.
## Features

Personalize Theme where it allows you select a theme you like, and then allowing it to record it so that next time you visit it will use the same theme you previously chose!
I also added video loops, and redirecting to websites on click for alot of the text in my website.
